# Code Laboratory
As an exercise, I try to solve kata in different programming languages. 

Here I share the implementations of the exercises I worked on, so that I can also compare myself with other solutions proposed by you.
 
## Contributing
Feel free to contribute, and submit new kata or propose alternative solutions. If you find a bug, let me know so we can discuss the solution.

## Challanges
In each folder you can find all the exercises and the challanges for the specific programming language
